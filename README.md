# Console-Application-for-Basic-CRUD-Operations-on-Task-List
This project implements a console-based application that performs basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of tasks. The tasks are managed using an array or list for data storage, and the application allows users to easily add, view, update, and remove tasks.
